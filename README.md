# Credit Risk Analysis (EDA)

---

### Overview

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand factors that lead to loan defaults. The goal is to identify patterns that help differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters.

### Datasets

Google Drive Link for the [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HZx_R0tNLFY8mMs7zls9QdP0AQpHlsUc?usp=sharing)

- application_data.csv – Applicant details and default status

- previous_application.csv – Past loan application information

- columns_description.csv – Description of variables

### What Was Done

---

- Checked data structure, missing values, and class imbalance

- Dropped columns with high missing data

- Filled missing values where needed

- Cleaned invalid values and created new features

- Performed univariate, bivariate, and correlation analysis

### Key Insights

---

- Higher credit or annuity burden increases default risk

- Lower external scores are linked to more defaults

- Longer employment history reduces default risk
